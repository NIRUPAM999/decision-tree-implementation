# Decision Tree Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree
classifier using Scikit-Learn. The model is trained on the Iris dataset to classify
flower species based on their features.

## Objective
- Implement a Decision Tree classifier
- Visualize the trained Decision Tree
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- **Iris Dataset**
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target Classes:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica

## Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Decision Tree classifier
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Visualize the Decision Tree

## Results
- The model achieves high accuracy on the test data
- Petal-related features play a significant role in classification
- The tree structure provides clear interpretability

## File Structure
- `TASK_1_Decision_Tree_Implementation.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how Decision Trees can be applied for
classification problems.
